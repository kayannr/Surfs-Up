## Climate Analysis and Exploration
Python and SQLAlchemy are used to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database. All of the following analysis are completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib:
* Use the provided [starter notebook](climate_starter.ipynb) and [hawaii.sqlite](Resources/hawaii.sqlite) files to complete your climate analysis and data exploration.

* Choose a start date and end date for your trip. Make sure that your vacation range is approximately 3-15 days total.

* Use SQLAlchemy `create_engine` to connect to your sqlite database.

* Use SQLAlchemy `automap_base()` to reflect your tables into classes and save a reference to those classes called `Station` and `Measurement`.
